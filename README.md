# Overview

I am a front-end engineer with over 5 years of experience in developing clean and easy-to-maintain solutions. My specialties are the Vue.js framework and its ecosystem (Pinia, VueRouter, TypeScript), along with a solid knowledge of web design, UI/UX, and modern methodologies such as SASS and Tailwind CSS.

I’m highly proactive and committed to continuous learning. What motivates me is the opportunity to craft intuitive, visually engaging web interfaces and write clean and maintainable codebases. For me, a well-structured codebase is the foundation of scalable and efficient software applications. My passion lies in bridging design and functionality — transforming design ideas into responsive, high-quality frontend apps.

Beyond programming, I continually pursue personal and professional growth. My favorite hobby is learning about History and discussing historical events and their significance for the world we live in.
