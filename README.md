# Overview

My name is Pedro Henrique Ferreti. I'm a web developer with over 5 years of front-end experience creating responsive and accessible websites using high-quality code. I'm a specialist in the Vue.js framework and its ecosystem, with a strong knowledge of web design, UI, and UX principles. I can perform system analysis tasks, such as identifying business requirements and translating them into software documents.

I’m a highly proactive developer with a commitment to continuous learning and execution. What motivates me is the opportunity to craft intuitive, visually engaging web interfaces that provide outstanding user experiences. I take pride in building clean, maintainable codebases that adhere to modern best practices, believing that well-structured code is the foundation of scalable and efficient web applications. My passion lies in bridging design and functionality—transforming creative ideas into responsive, high-quality frontend solutions.
